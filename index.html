excerpt: >
  I am a Computational Scientist with expertise in the numerical solution of mathematical models
  described by Partial Differential Equations, with applications to multi-physics and multi-scale problems
  such as hydro-mechanical, thermo-mechanical, and hydro-chemo-mechanical processes in fracture porous media,
  as well as seismic wave propagation.
