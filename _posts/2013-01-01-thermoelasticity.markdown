Thermoelasticity equations are employed to simulate the deformation of a cooktop
during its heating process.
Deformations can be relatively large and can make cooktop's surface not flat.
As a consequence, pots will not adhere to the surface and energetic efficiency of the cooktop
may be affected.

In this project, we simulated cooktop's deformations.
The geometry employed is a realistic one from an industrial partner.
It features three wires that make three rounds over the vertical axis.

Thermoelasticty equations have been implemented both in **UG** and **FreeFem++**.
